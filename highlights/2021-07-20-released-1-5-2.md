## Enhancements

### About poller

By default, `gnet` utilizes the standard package `golang.org/x/sys/unix` to implement pollers with `epoll` or `kqueue`, where a HASH MAP of `fd->conn` is introduced to help retrieve connections by file descriptors returned from pollers, but now the user can run `go build` with build tags `poll_opt`, like this: `go build -tags=poll_opt`, and `gnet` then switch to the optimized implementations of pollers that invoke the system calls of `epoll` or `kqueue` directly and add file descriptors to the interest list along with storing the corresponding connection pointers into `epoll_data` or `kevent`, in which case `gnet` can get rid of the HASH MAP of `fd->conn` and regain each connection pointer by the conversion of `void*` pointer in the I/O event-looping. In theory, it ought to achieve a higher performance with this optimization. 

See [#230](https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet/pull/230) for code details.

### About ring-buffer

Adjust the growth strategy of ring-buffer, make it go more smoothly rather than simply doubling up (which may waste a huge amount of memory) in each buffer scaling.
