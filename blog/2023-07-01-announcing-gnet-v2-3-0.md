Today, I'm thrilled to announce the official release of [gnet v2.3.0](https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet/releases/tag/v2.3.0).

P.S. Follow me on Twitter [@panjf2000](https://twitter.com/panjf2000) to get the latest updates about gnet!

## Intro

The two major updates in this release are [#460](https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet/pull/460) and [#461](https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet/pull/461).

We introduced a new data structure `matrix` in [#460](https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet/pull/460) to displace the default `map` for managing connections internally, with the help of this new data structure, we can eliminate the pointers in `map` and store connections in the form of a matrix (an array of slices), which will significantly reduce GC (Garbage Collection) latency:

**The more connections there are, the more pronounced the effect.**

While we have performed sufficient testing on `matrix`, we are still using `map` as the default connection storage in this RC version for the sake of caution, but you can enable the new data structure by specifying build tags: -tags=gc_opt. This can be considered as a precautionary measure so that in case `matrix` has any unexpected bugs, you can quickly fall back to the default `map`. We will consider promoting `matrix` to be the default storage for connections in a subsequent official release.

Another significant leap is [#461](https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet/pull/461), you can now run `gnet` on Windows, it should be noted that the Windows version of `gnet` is intended for development purposes and is not recommended for use in production.
